# Wishlist

This is the full source code of my personal wishlist project.
You can see the application running under:

https://wishlist.aidado.com

The project make use of the following technologies:
- Angular 8
- Google Firebase and Firestore
- Bootstrap 5

I removed redux out of the project as it made things more complicated. But I used some of the ideas, like the global store and reducer like functions.
